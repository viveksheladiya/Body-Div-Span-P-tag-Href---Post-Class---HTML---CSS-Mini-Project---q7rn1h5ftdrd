            Any building requires a certain general amount of internal infrastructure to function, which includes such elements like
            heating / cooling, power and telecommunications, water and wastewater etc. Especially in commercial buildings, these can be
            extremely intricate systems taking up large amounts of space and constitute a big part of the regular maintenance required.

            Building types may range from huts to multimillion-dollar high-rise apartment blocks able to house thousands of people.
            Increasing settlement density in buildings is usually a response to high ground prices resulting from many people wanting to 
            live close to work or similar attractors.

            Ever since the first cave paintings, buildings have also become objects or canvasses of much artistic expression. In
            recent years, interest in sustainable planning and building practices has also become an intentional part of the design
            process of many new buildings and other structures.
